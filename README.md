Tools Used:
Figma – For wireframing, UI design, prototyping, and user flows.

Design Process Overview:
User Research – Basic research and competitor analysis to identify user needs.

Wireframing – Low-fidelity wireframes were created in Figma to map out layout and navigation.

UI Design – High-fidelity screens were designed using Figma’s auto-layout, components, and style guides.

Prototyping – Interactive prototype created in Figma to demonstrate user flow and interactions.

Developer Handoff – Design specifications and assets were shared with the development team directly via Figma.
